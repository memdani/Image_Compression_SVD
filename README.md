# Image_Compression
_**Abstract**_—The increasing usage of digital information also requires storage and transmission of images and videos. A technique called SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) is used to compress these images without affecting the quality of the image. This linear matrix transformation uses a product of three matrices and compresses the image by keeping necessary features. It finds the basic structure of the image by transformation into a series of linear approximations. The main idea behind this is to select some eigenvalues to compress and reconstruct the image. It deals with the rank of image and compression ratio.

_**Keywords**_— Singular Value Decomposition, linear matrix transformation, linear approximations, eigenvalues, rank, compression ratio.
